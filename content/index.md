My name is Robin Mueller and I love to code! I studied aerospace engineering at the University
Stuttgart and have started working as a PhD student at the
[Institute of Space Systems](https://www.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/en/).

I am currently working on the [EIVE](https://www.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/en/research/satellitetechnology-and-instruments/smallsatelliteprogram/EIVE/)
and [SOURCE](https://www.ksat-stuttgart.de/en/our-projects/source/) CubeSat projects, but my research
focus will be on investigating Rust as a modern and safe alternative to C/C++ for satellite
software.
