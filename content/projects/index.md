Here is a list of projects I am currently working on or contributing to.

- [EIVE satellite project](https://www.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/en/research/satellitetechnology-and-instruments/smallsatelliteprogram/EIVE/)
   and the corresponding
   [EIVE On-Board Software](https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/eive/eive-obsw/). I wrote large parts
   of the software which are now running on the EIVE satellite launched in June 2023.
- [FSFW](https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw): I contributed a lot to the Flight Software
   Framework which is the framework used for both the [SOURCE](https://www.ksat-stuttgart.de/en/our-projects/source/)
   and [EIVE](https://www.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/en/research/satellitetechnology-and-instruments/smallsatelliteprogram/EIVE/) project.
- [sat-rs framework](https://documentation.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/sat-rs.html): I am working on the
   Rust port of the FSFW as part of my PhD thesis.
- spacepackets open source libraries: I wrote a [Python](https://github.com/us-irs/spacepackets-py)
   and a [Rust](https://github.com/us-irs/spacepackets-rs) library for CCSDS and ECSS packet
   standards
