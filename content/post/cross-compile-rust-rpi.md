After exploring Rust for smaller bare-metal systems like Cortex-M based microcontrollers, I am
trying to learn using Rust when using a Linux runtime. The most common example for this is the
[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), but there are a lot of other boards out there
which support Embedded Linux, for example the [Beagle Bone Black](https://beagleboard.org/black) or
Xilinx hybrid CPU / FPGA solutions like the
[Zynq 7020](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/zynq-7000.html).

I am especially interested in potential of Rust to develop more complex applications and allow
remote development for Linux boards. All of this generally requires cross-compiling. For most
use-cases and simpler projects, compiling and running the applications on the Linux boards directly
is a lot simpler then the effort of setting up a cross-compiling environment on a host machine.

## Some Background Information

If you're only interested in the result and on how to quickly cross-develop applications for your
Linux board, go to the [next section](#crossbuild).

My experiences when developing something like satellite software for an Embedded Linux Software
is the following:

1. Even though there is a Linux runtime, it might not support compiling
   applications on the board directly. For example, the
   [Q7S](https://xiphos.com/products/q7-processor/) used in one of our
   projects has a root file system limit of 32 MB, so it does not even
   contain something like header files.
2. There is generally one monolithic software written in C or C++ and which
   contains all the application logic. It contains most of the dependencies,
   for example on libraries for a certain device like a Star Tracker. This means
   the compilation times are long. Even if the Linux boards support
   compilation, compiling the primary software on the board becomes unfeasable.
3. There are only 1-2 of the On-Board Computers available. For example, one is a
   Flight Model which remains packaged until satellite asembly while the other one is the
   Engineering Model which has to stay in the clean room. Allowing convenient development
   requires remote deployment of the application. Otherwise, one would have to go
   into the cleanroom for every small test and change I want to introduce.
4. The software is complex and debugging can become complex too. Printouts and LEDs
   are not sufficient anymore to debug the software, a full debugger is required additionally.

For that reason, convenient cross-compilation and debugging is a must for me when considering
Rust as an alternative to C/C++ on systems like the [Q7S](https://xiphos.com/products/q7-processor/).
I have only found bits and pieces in the Internet on how to properly do this. Therefore, I have
created a [template repository](https://github.com/robamu-org/rpi-rs-crosscompile) which gathers
all those bits and pieces into one package.
I specifically targeted debugging with the command line and with VS Code as those tools are most
commonly used in Rust development from what I have seen so far.
The instrutions provided here have been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 21.04) and Windows 10, but I really
recommend to use a Linux development hosted when developing anything for an Embedded Linux board.

## <a name="crossbuild"></a>  Cross-Building a Rust application for the Raspberry Pi

The instructions here are based on
[this excellent guide](https://chacin.dev/blog/cross-compiling-rust-for-the-raspberry-pi/).

Clone the template repository first:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/robamu-org/rpi-rs-crosscompile.git
```

You can also use the template functionality of GitHub to create your own custom repository.
Cross-Building an application for the Raspberry Pi still requires a C/C++ cross-toolchain to compile
Rust with an ARM linker.
Make sure to download a suitable cross-compiler. Most of the automation
performed by the repository is done in a Python script, so it is recommended
to [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) as well.

Make sure you can call it from the command line

**Linux**:

```console
[Raspberry Pi 4] rmueller@power-pinguin:~/Rust/rpi-rs-crosscompile(main)$ python3 --version
Python 3.9.7
```

**Windows**:

```console
Robin@DESKTOP-7KSTH01 MSYS ~/Documents/Rust/rpi-rs-crosscompile (main)
$ py --version
Python 3.9.0
```

You need to install `scp` and `ssh` for the Python script to work. There are different ways to
do this, for example by installing Puttty or by installing these tools with MinGW64.

### Setting up the Raspberry Pi

There are different ways to avoid having to retype the password everytime
when tranferring an application to the Raspberry Pi or running an application
remotely. On Linux, you can use `sshpass` for this.

The most easiest way and the one I recommend is to install your SSH key
on the Raspberry Pi with `ssh-copy-id`. This works on Linux and Windows.
You can follow the steps specified [here](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/copy-id) to do this.

Another way is to use a SSH key file by supplying the `-f SSHFILE` flag
to the `bld-deploy-remote.py` application in your `.cargo/config.toml`
or as an environmental variable `SSHPASS` with the `-e` flag.

### Setup Linux

You can create a cross-compiler built with crosstool-ng
from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hkn4lw87zr002fh/AAAO-HxFQzfmmPQQ9KVmoooGa?dl=0). There is one
available for the Raspberry Pi 3 and the Raspberry Pi 4.

Following command should get the job done, assuming you
installed the cross-compiler shown above into the `$HOME/x-tools` folder:

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:"$HOME/x-tools/armv8-rpi4-linux-gnueabihf/bin"
```

You can also put this in a script named `rpi4-path.sh` and source it
with `. rpi4-path.sh` or your can put it in your `.bashrc` file to add it
to `$PATH` permanently.

Test with `armv8-rpi4-linux-gnueabihf-gcc --version`:

```console
[Raspberry Pi 4] rmueller@power-pinguin:~/Rust$ armv8-rpi4-linux-gnueabihf-gcc --version
armv8-rpi4-linux-gnueabihf-gcc (crosstool-NG 1.24.0.390_62e9db2) 8.5.0
Copyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
```

Proceed with the generic setup.

### Setup Windows

It is recommended to install the cross-toolchain provided by
[SysProgs](https://gnutoolchains.com/raspberry/).

Add the binary path of your installed cross-toolchain for your path.

You can add the toolchain binary path to your system environmental variables
permanently, for example like shown here:


If you use `git bash`, you can also use the Linux way shown above.
Test with `arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc --version`:

```ps
C:\Users\Robin\Documents\Rust\rpi-rs-crosscompile [main â‰¡]> arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc --version
arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc.exe (Raspbian 8.3.0-6+rpi1) 8.3.0
Copyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
```

Proceed with the generic setup.

### Generic Setup

Now you are ready to build the first application for the Raspberry Pi.
The `.cargo/def-config.toml` file is a template for a Cargo configuration
to perform flashing conveniently. Copy it to `.cargo/config.toml` first:

```sh
cd .cargo
cp def-config.toml config.toml
```

Then open the `config.toml` with a text editor of your choice and select
the correct linker first, for example with `armv8-rpi4-linux-gnueabihf-gcc` on Linux or
`arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc` on Windows:

```toml
# If you use a different cross-compiler, adapt this flag accordingly.
# linker = "armv8-rpi4-linux-gnueabihf-gcc"
# linker = "arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc"
# linker = "arm-none-linux-gnueabihf-gcc"
```

Then select the correct runner to run the application instead of debugging it. For Windows,
select a runner using `py`.

**Linux**:

```toml
# Requires Python3 installation. Takes care of transferring and running the application
# to the Raspberry Pi
# runner = "py bld-deploy-remote.py -t -r --source"
runner = "python3 bld-deploy-remote.py -t -r --source"
...
# runner = "py bld-deploy-remote.py -t -d --source"
# runner = "python3 bld-deploy-remote.py -t -d --source"
...
# runner = "py bld-deploy-remote.py -t -d -s --gdb arm-linux-gnueabihf-gdb --source"
# runner = "python3 bld-deploy-remote.py -t -d --source"
```

**Windows**:

```toml
# Requires Python3 installation. Takes care of transferring and running the application
# to the Raspberry Pi
runner = "py bld-deploy-remote.py -t -r --source"
# runner = "python3 bld-deploy-remote.py -t -r --source"
...
# runner = "py bld-deploy-remote.py -t -d --source"
# runner = "python3 bld-deploy-remote.py -t -d --source"
...
# runner = "py bld-deploy-remote.py -t -d -s --gdb arm-linux-gnueabihf-gdb --source"
# runner = "python3 bld-deploy-remote.py -t -d --source"
```

Finally select the correct builder depending on whether you have a Raspberry Pi 0/1
or a Raspberry Pi 2/3/4

### Building the application

Everything should be ready to build the application.
Simply use `cargo build`.

### Running the application

Everything should be ready to run the application remotely now.
Running the application is very simple now: Use `cargo run`, which will also build the application
automatically:

**Linux**:

```console

As you can see, all commands executed by the Python scripts are shown as well.

## Debugging the application on the Command Line

You can switch to the debugging configuration by changing the runner accordingly

**Linux**:

```toml
# Requires Python3 installation. Takes care of transferring and running the application
# to the Raspberry Pi
# runner = "py bld-deploy-remote.py -t -r --source"
# runner = "python3 bld-deploy-remote.py -t -r --source"
...
# runner = "py bld-deploy-remote.py -t -d --source"
# runner = "python3 bld-deploy-remote.py -t -d --source"
...
# runner = "py bld-deploy-remote.py -t -d -s --gdb arm-linux-gnueabihf-gdb --source"
runner = "python3 bld-deploy-remote.py -t -d --source"
```

Console output:

...
runner = "py bld-deploy-remote.py -t -d -s --gdb arm-linux-gnueabihf-gdb --source"
# runner = "python3 bld-deploy-remote.py -t -d --source"
```

Now, you can use `cargo run` like before, but this time the Python helper program will
start a GDB server on the Pi and then launch a GDB application locally to debug the program.

## Debugging the application with VS Code and `CodeLLDB`

I think the best debugging experience is still provided by GUI tools like Eclipse or VS Code.
The following examples are shown for Linux. The second one should work for Windows as well,
but I had issues getting the first configuration to work on Windows.

### GDB server started by VS Code

Unfortunately, I have not found a way to get the debug output produced by an application
when starting the GDB server with VS code. Feel free to investigate how this could be solved
using VS Code tasks.

You can simply select and run the `Remote Debugging With Server` configuration
in VS Code. The result should look something like the following:

<center>
{{< figure
    src="/img/rpi-rs-crosscompile/debug-vscode-with-server.png"
    alt="Debugging with VS Code with GDB Server started by VS Code"
    caption="Debugging with VS Code with GDB Server started by VS Code"
>}}
</center>

### GDB server started externally

The only difference is that the GDB server is now started in an external shell
instance, which also allows to see debug output produced by the application.
Configuring `.cargo/config.toml` correctlys allows simply using `cargo run`:

```toml
# Requires Python3 installation. Takes care of transferring and running the application
# to the Raspberry Pi
# runner = "py bld-deploy-remote.py -t -r --source"
# runner = "python3 bld-deploy-remote.py -t -r --source"
...
# runner = "py bld-deploy-remote.py -t -d --source"
runner = "python3 bld-deploy-remote.py -t -d --source"
...
# runner = "py bld-deploy-remote.py -t -d -s --gdb arm-linux-gnueabihf-gdb --source"
# runner = "python3 bld-deploy-remote.py -t -d --source"
```

After using `cargo run`, you can run the `Remote Debugging External Server`
configuration in VS Code. The result should look something like the following:

<center>
{{< figure
    src="/img/rpi-rs-crosscompile/debug-vscode-external-server.png"
    alt="Debugging with VS Code with externally startred GDB server"
    caption="Debugging with VS Code with externally startred GDB server"
>}}
</center>

## Under the hood

If you're interested how exactly this is done in VS Code, you can have a look at the
[`launch.json`](https://github.com/robamu-org/rpi-rs-crosscompile/blob/main/.vscode/launch.json)
and [`tasks.json`](https://github.com/robamu-org/rpi-rs-crosscompile/blob/main/.vscode/tasks.json)
provided in the [template repository](https://github.com/robamu-org/rpi-rs-crosscompile/tree/main/.vscode).

These generally call the `bld-deploy-remote.py` script, which can be found
[here](https://github.com/robamu-org/rpi-rs-crosscompile/blob/main/bld-deploy-remote.py).
This script automates one to all of the following steps which are generally required to deploy and
debug a cross-compiled application:

1. Build the application. When using a Cargo runner, Cargo will take care of this step
2. Transfer the application to the Raspberry Pi using the `-t` flag. The default destination
   is the `/tmp` folder, but this can be customized with the `--dest` flag
3. Start the `gdbserver` on the Raspberry Pi. The script also sets up port forwarding on the port
   17777 so that the development host can simply connect to `localhost:17777`
4. Start the GDB application to debug the software

Using Python to perform these steps provides a little bit more flexiblity and portability in
my opinion. It also makes it easier to adapt the script to custom requirements, because
Python has the most easiest and most readable syntax of all automation tools I have worked with.

This script can also be easily ported to other Embedded Linux board by tweaking the
`DEFAULT_*` parameters found at the top of the Python script.

## Room for Impovements

I have not really looked into how tools like [`cross`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross)
could be used to simplify this process. I think some steps might become easier but using `cross`
also requires `docker`. I think the ways to run and deploy cross-compiled software shown here
are sufficient for most use-cases. I might try out cross in the future though.
