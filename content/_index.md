My name is Robin Mueller and you find find some of the projects
I work on this website. I studied aerospace engineering at the University Stuttgart and I have started
working as a PhD student at the [Institute of Space Systems](https://www.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/en/).

My research focus is the investigation of Rust as a modern and safe alternative to C/C++ for
flight software. You can see an overview of all my projects at the
[project page]({{< ref "/projects" >}}).
