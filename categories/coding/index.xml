This development board also has a MAX11619 10-bit ADC device by Maxim devices. I thought this was a good opportunity to develop my first device driver crate because there isn&amp;rsquo;t one for this device yet.
The REB1 development board also has a 2K potentiometer connected directly to a channel of the ADC which makes testing convenient.</description></item><item><title>Throwback - GSoC 2020 | Device handler development for the SOURCE project</title><link>https://robamu.github.io/post/gsoc-post/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 19:29:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://robamu.github.io/post/gsoc-post/</guid><description>This is an adapted version of a blog post initially posted on Wordpress as part of my GSoC project. It&amp;rsquo;s a perfect way for me to set up my own first blog which is based on this excellent guide.
At that point of time, I was an aerospace engineer doing my graduate studies at the University of Stuttgart. I&amp;rsquo;m still active in the small satellite society KSat but I am doing more of a supporting role now that I started working the University as a PhD student.</description></item></channel></rss>
