This development board also has a MAX11619 10-bit ADC device by Maxim devices. I thought this was a good opportunity to develop my first device driver crate because there isn&amp;rsquo;t one for this device yet.
The REB1 development board also has a 2K potentiometer connected directly to a channel of the ADC which makes testing convenient.</description></item><item><title>Bringing Rust to Space - Setting up a Rust ecosystem for the VA108XX MCU family</title><link>https://robamu.github.io/post/rust-ecosystem/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 23:31:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://robamu.github.io/post/rust-ecosystem/</guid><description>The last few weeks I have been busy diving into the Rust ecosystem and learning the language through practical projects. I finishing the excellent Rust book and the Rust Embedded Book first and then tinkered with Rust on some STM32 MCUs. As a next step, I was looking for practical projects to further learn the language. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to combine this with the usual activities at the research institute I work now as well.</description></item></channel></rss>
