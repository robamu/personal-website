The most common example for this is the Raspberry Pi, but there are a lot of other boards out there which support Embedded Linux, for example the Beagle Bone Black or Xilinx hybrid CPU / FPGA solutions like the Zynq 7020.

This development board also has a MAX11619 10-bit ADC device by Maxim devices. I thought this was a good opportunity to develop my first device driver crate because there isn&amp;rsquo;t one for this device yet.
The REB1 development board also has a 2K potentiometer connected directly to a channel of the ADC which makes testing convenient.</description></item><item><title>Bringing Rust to Space - Setting up a Rust ecosystem for the VA108XX MCU family</title><link>https://robamu.github.io/posts/rust-ecosystem/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 23:31:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://robamu.github.io/posts/rust-ecosystem/</guid><description>The last few weeks I have been busy diving into the Rust ecosystem and learning the language through practical projects. I finishing the excellent Rust book and the Rust Embedded Book first and then tinkered with Rust on some STM32 MCUs. As a next step, I was looking for practical projects to further learn the language. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to combine this with the usual activities at the research institute I work now as well.</description></item><item><title>Throwback - GSoC 2020 | Device handler development for the SOURCE project</title><link>https://robamu.github.io/posts/gsoc-post/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 19:29:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://robamu.github.io/posts/gsoc-post/</guid><description>This is an adapted version of a blog post initially posted on Wordpress as part of my GSoC project. It&amp;rsquo;s a perfect way for me to set up my own first blog which is based on this excellent guide.
At that point of time, I was an aerospace engineer doing my graduate studies at the University of Stuttgart. I&amp;rsquo;m still active in the small satellite society KSat but I am doing more of a supporting role now that I started working the University as a PhD student.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://robamu.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 21:53:29 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://robamu.github.io/about/</guid><description>My name is Robin Mueller and I love to code! I studied aerospace engineering at the University Stuttgart and have started working as a PhD student at the Institute of Space Systems.
I am currently working on the EIVE and SOURCE CubeSat projects, but my research focus will be on investigating Rust as a modern and safe alternative to C/C++ for satellite software.</description></item><item><title>Get in touch</title><link>https://robamu.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 21:53:29 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://robamu.github.io/contact/</guid><description>Name E-mail address Message Send (Powered by Un-static Forms)</description></item></channel></rss>
