The special thing about space is that instead of using newline and/or UTF-8 based data, the data is generally in binary format and packet based. The most prevalent of the space packet standards is probably the CCSDS Space Packet Protocol.</description></item><item><title>Packaging Python Projects in 2023</title><link>https://robamu.github.io/blog/packaging-python-in-2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 16:32:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://robamu.github.io/blog/packaging-python-in-2023/</guid><description>Learning clean package management with Pyhon is still a tricky subject even though there are a lot of resources available online. A lot of the resources found online only cover partial topics while others make recommendations which are becoming slowly obsolete, for example by still using setup.py. In this post, I will show how to set up a new package in Python from scratch with all features I consider useful and important for a good Python package.</description></item><item><title>Cross-Compile and Debug Rust Applications for the Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://robamu.github.io/blog/cross-compile-rust-rpi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 12:31:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://robamu.github.io/blog/cross-compile-rust-rpi/</guid><description>After exploring Rust for smaller bare-metal systems like Cortex-M based microcontrollers, I am trying to learn using Rust when using a Linux runtime. The most common example for this is the Raspberry Pi, but there are a lot of other boards out there which support Embedded Linux, for example the Beagle Bone Black or Xilinx hybrid CPU / FPGA solutions like the Zynq 7020.

This development board also has a MAX11619 10-bit ADC device by Maxim devices. I thought this was a good opportunity to develop my first device driver crate because there isn&amp;rsquo;t one for this device yet.
The REB1 development board also has a 2K potentiometer connected directly to a channel of the ADC which makes testing convenient.</description></item><item><title>Bringing Rust to Space - Setting up a Rust ecosystem for the VA108XX MCU family</title><link>https://robamu.github.io/blog/rust-ecosystem/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 23:31:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://robamu.github.io/blog/rust-ecosystem/</guid><description>The last few weeks I have been busy diving into the Rust ecosystem and learning the language through practical projects. I finishing the excellent Rust book and the Rust Embedded Book first and then tinkered with Rust on some STM32 MCUs. As a next step, I was looking for practical projects to further learn the language. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to combine this with the usual activities at the research institute I work now as well.</description></item><item><title>Throwback - GSoC 2020 | Device handler development for the SOURCE project</title><link>https://robamu.github.io/blog/gsoc-post/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 19:29:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://robamu.github.io/blog/gsoc-post/</guid><description>This is an adapted version of a blog post initially posted on Wordpress as part of my GSoC project. It&amp;rsquo;s a perfect way for me to set up my own first blog which is based on this excellent guide.
At that point of time, I was an aerospace engineer doing my graduate studies at the University of Stuttgart. I&amp;rsquo;m still active in the small satellite society KSat but I am doing more of a supporting role now that I started working the University as a PhD student.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://robamu.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 21:53:29 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://robamu.github.io/contact/</guid><description>Get in touch Name E-mail address Message Send (Powered by Un-static Forms)</description></item><item><title/><link>https://robamu.github.io/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robamu.github.io/projects/</guid><description>Here is a list of projects I am currently working on or contributing to.
EIVE satellite project and the corresponding EIVE On-Board Software. I wrote large parts of the software which are now running on the EIVE satellite launched in June 2023. FSFW: I contributed a lot to the Flight Software Framework which is the framework used for both the SOURCE and EIVE project. sat-rs framework: I am working on the Rust port of the FSFW as part of my PhD thesis.</description></item></channel></rss>
